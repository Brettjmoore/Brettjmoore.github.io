<p>I took two influences when creating this masterpiece of a song. My first influence was from my lovely girlfriend Daniella, who loves EDM <br>
and wanted to see me throw it down and create some sick beats. So I dedicate this song to her! My second influence was DJ Snake, specifically <br>
his song Turn Down For What, which has to be the most OG buildup of all EDM in my opinion.</p>
